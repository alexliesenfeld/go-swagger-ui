# go-swagger-ui

`go-swagger-ui` provides a simple way to serve Swagger UI in your Go web application. 
It embeds Swagger UI and provides a customizable [http.Handler](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Handler) 
to serve it.

## Features

* Provides a customizable HTTP Handler to serve Swagger UI.
* Supports many of Swagger UI's configuration options.
* Supports dynamic UI configuration in your Go application.
* Provides a CLI application to open OpenAPI specification files in a Swagger UI instance (browser window).

## Installation

To install the `go-swagger-ui` package, use the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/alexliesenfeld/go-swagger-ui
```

## Usage
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	swaggerui "github.com/alexliesenfeld/go-swagger-ui"
	"log"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", swaggerui.NewHandler(
		swaggerui.WithHTMLTitle("My Example Petstore API"),
		swaggerui.WithSpecURL("https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json"),
		swaggerui.WithTryItOutEnabled(true),
		swaggerui.WithPersistAuthorization(true),
	))

	fmt.Println("Starting server at port 8080")
	if err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

## CLI Usage

Install the CLI application:

```bash
go install github.com/alexliesenfeld/go-swagger-ui/cmd/swui@latest
```

You can then use the CLI tool to serve OpenAPI spec files in a separate Swagger UI instance in a browser window.
```bash
swui /path/to/openapi-spec.yaml
```

`swui` also allows you to reload the browser window to see changes made to the spec file.

## Roadmap

- [x] Embed Swagger UI
- [x] Provide simple but powerful `http.Handler` that is compatible with major web libraries
- [x] Allow to change the majority of configuration parameters from within a Go application
- [x] Make it possible to configure multiple spec file urls
- [x] Provide a CLI tool to view OpenAPI spec files locally in a browser
- [ ] Add OAuth2 configuration possibilities (https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/docs/usage/oauth2.md)
- [ ] Make plugins configurable
- [ ] Make presets configurable
- [ ] Allow using CDN instead of embedding Swagger UI
